Three data-driven R projects exploring biology and environmental datasets with statistical methods

# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio!  

I am currently pursuing a Graduate Diploma in Data Analytics at the University of Waikato. This repository showcases three hands-on projects where I applied data exploration, visualization, and statistical modeling techniques using R.

## Projects Included

1. **Penguin Flipper Length Analysis**  
   Investigates how flipper lengths vary among penguin species using histograms, density plots, boxplots, and ANOVA tests.

2. **Tooth Growth Analysis**  
   Examines the impact of supplement type and dosage on tooth growth through t-tests, linear modeling, and confidence interval visualization.

3. **Crab Premolt vs Postmolt Analysis**  
   Models the relationship between crab premolt and postmolt sizes using linear regression and confidence intervals, complemented by insightful visualizations.

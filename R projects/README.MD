# Data Analytics Portfolio - Waikato University Graduate Diploma

This repository contains three data analysis projects completed using R. Each project includes a dataset (CSV) and an R script demonstrating data exploration, visualization, and statistical modeling techniques.

All projects are contained in this single folder along with a master RStudio project file to streamline your workflow.

## Contents

### Data Files (CSV)
- `penguins.csv`  
- `ToothGrowth.csv`  
- `dungeness-crabs.csv`  

### R Scripts
- `penguin_flipper_length_analysis.R`  
  - Explores differences in penguin flipper lengths by species using histograms, density plots, boxplots, and ANOVA tests.
  
- `tooth_growth_analysis.R`  
  - Analyzes the effect of supplement type and dose on tooth growth with t-tests, linear models, and confidence interval visualization.
  
- `crab_premolt_analysis.R`  
  - Models the relationship between premolt and postmolt crab mass using linear regression and confidence intervals, with clear data visualization.

### R Project File
- `master_R_project.Rproj`  
  - An RStudio project file that links all analyses and sets the working directory to this folder.
